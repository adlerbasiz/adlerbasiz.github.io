									<td> Effective connections between radiographers and patients are built on a 
										foundation of advanced communication techniques (Halkett et al., 2010; Pollard et al., 
										2019). I possess the ability to explain complex imaging procedures in English, Cantonese
										 and Mandarin in an effective and patient-comforting manner.  </td>
										 
										  <td> Multilingual radiographers

									<td>I was explaining the procedure of a contrast-enhanced CT 
										scan to Patient X. Patient X was from a non-English speaking background and refused to 
										sign the consent form. I spotted her consent form was in Chinese, thus I explained the
										 consent required using Mandarin. Patient X expressed her concern, that she had her 
										 previous contrast scan one week before.  </td>
										 <td>I indicated that she had a satisfactory renal 
											function. Her estimated glomerular filtration rate was far greater than 45, thus the 
											risk of contrast-induced kidney injury is close to nil (Davenport et al., 2020). She 
											was still reluctant to perform the scan but she was less anxious. I negotiated with 
											her that I will halve the contrast media given to her and attempt the scan,</td>
											<td>and both my supervisor and Patient X agreed to proceed with the scan in this case. The 
												final image quality is acceptable, and Patient X was satisfied that a multilingual 
												radiographer with good communication skills was present in this practice and the 
												solution was figured out eventually. In this case, consent was obtained with the 
												consideration of patient autonomy and safety, which is an ethical practice (Haskell, 2019).</td>

									<td>As a student radiographer, I understand my limitation that I need further experience 
										to be more confident in my practice. I was assigned to perform x-rays in a urology 
										case alone and I arrived at the theatre's front door with the fluoroscopy machine. </td>

										<td> The circulating nurse spotted my arrival and advised me to wait until the patient
										  was draped, to better protect patient privacy. The patient was uncovered on the
										   table for surgical site disinfection, opening the front door to push the machine
											in during that time might cause a breach of patient confidentiality. Theatre
											 staff have the duty to identify circumstances or actions that could violate
											  patient privacy (Blomberg et al., 2015).</td> <td> Therefore, I waited until the patient 
											  was covered and then brought the machine in for intraoperative imaging. In 
											  this case, I learnt actively and accepted advice from other experienced medical
											   professionals to improve my professionalism in medical imaging.</td></tr>
									
											   <td> Interprofessional 
												learning has benefited my experience in ethical practices, moreover, effective 
												interprofessional communication and active listening were involved to deliver 
												ethical and patient-oriented care. Examples of my interprofessional learning
												 include interventional CT imaging with radiologists,</td> <td> swallow test imaging 
												 with speech pathologists, intraoperative imaging, mobile imaging, a 
												 multi-disciplinary care plan development event named Health Collaboration
												  Challenge etc. In order to be a competent radiographer in the future, I
												   will continue to work on my communication and ethical skills. </td>

								  <td>Medical imaging practice must be constantly backed by evidence (Hoffmann et al., 2017). Medical radiation 
									practitioners are obliged to recognize any problem or uncertainty they have in their practice and seek an 
									answer via research (Medical Radiation Practice Board of Australia, 2020). I was undertaking a project about
									 aseptic techniques in handling pressure injectors for the delivery of contrast agents. </td>
								  <td>Pressure injectors are present in most computed tomography [CT] environments (Ma et al., 2012), thus 
									contrast-enhanced CT scans can be carried out. In my previous placement sites, I observed that the healthcare
									 workers do not have a uniform protocol for teaching students about injector machines and administering contrast.
									  Student practitioners could access the pressure injectors without an introductory session offered by the supervisors. </td>
								  <td>In addition, when I was seeking advice related to pressure injectors, different supervisors had different measures for 
									maintaining the sterility of the content inside the injectors. I was doing research online after working hours so that 
									I could find out the correct method to approach the injector machines, but the materials I found might not be reliable 
									in best guaranteeing patient safety.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
								  <td>This brought my attention to the underlying issues in the aspects of infection prevention and control. In my literature review,
									 blood-borne diseases are occasionally transmitted in clinical environments due to inappropriate injection techniques
									  (Khan et al., 2017).  In studies investigating the origin of several clusters of hospital-acquired infections 
									  (Balmelli et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2006), reusing the same disposable item on the same or a different patient 
									  happened frequently,</td>
								  <td>including but not limited to the procedures of administering contrast.  Moreover, an incorrect dirty-to-clean approach
									 could have been used, staff might detach the injector disposable extension line from the patient first, and then detach 
									 the line from the machine without changing gloves in between the steps (Pa√±ella et al., 2008). These maneuvers might be 
									 taught to and performed by student practitioners and result in a breach of infection prevention and control [IPC] standards. </td>
								  <td>Ethical medical radiation practitioners should prioritize patient safety under all circumstances; therefore, it is essential
									 to conduct research on this topic and support IPC education and practice with more evidence. I will conduct a survey to 
									 find out the level of student involvement in assisting with the set-up of the contrast delivery system, also whether their 
									 routine set-up and management follow the IPC standard. My study serves as a component of another core project related to 
									 infection control in radiography. </td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Within this project, I acquired basic knowledge of the main steps in the research pathway, from study method to data 
										analysis and publication. The project sharpens my critical thinking skills and path my future by fulfilling the need 
										for professional development. As a novice researcher, I still have a large gap for improvement. </td>
									<td>The assistance from supervising professors and lecturers is of utmost importance, they provide constructive feedback on
										 my research studies and the advice benefited my research skills as well my inventiveness. </td>

								  <td>Inventiveness and influence are listed in the nine qualities that top universities expect students to 
									graduate with (The University of Sydney, 2020). Inventiveness is the process of developing innovative 
									concepts and approaches in radiography, halving the contrast given to Patient X as aforementioned can 
									demonstrate my ability to solve unexpected challenges via creative ideas and methods that are practical. </td>
								  <td>For example, I was performing intraoperative imaging without supervisors and my fluoroscopy machine 
									experienced a breakdown. I attempted to reboot the system but in vain. In this situation, I was expected 
									to make a call down to the radiology department for assistance, but in order not to disturb the surgery
									 progress I decided to mobilize other non-sterile medical personnel and bring in the spare fluoroscopy machine.</td>
								  <td>The surgery was completed without delay and the surgeon was satisfied that the issue was managed well. 
									In another example, I was performing modified foot x-rays on a wheelchair patient with extensive swelling
									 around his foot. As he could not tolerate any hard surface including the image receptor [IR] board, I 
									 performed the x-rays with a tiny object image distance. I placed the image receptor on the floor, and he was
									  in his wheelchair with his foot hanging slightly above the IR. </td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
								  <td>IR position and tube angle were adjusted accordingly. The lateral foot x-ray was taken with an IR holder 
									on the medial side of the foot. Image quality was acceptable and patient discomfort was minimized. Influence 
									is the connection and engagement with others in different ideas and visions (The University of Sydney, 2020). 
									As a student radiographer, I am constantly improving and influenced by lecturers and supervisors positively. 
									I was explaining to junior radiography students in my clinical site, particularly in the operating theatres 
									and CT scanner rooms. </td>
								  <td>As junior students are less experienced in advanced modalities, I was assigned to give a general introduction
									 of theatre and CT environment to them. In addition, I showed them my basic maneuvers and gave them attempts
									  to perform some simple tasks, including driving the fluoroscopy machine from the equipment room to the 
									  theatre suite, raising or lowering the CT bed etc. These simple tasks were effective for students to work
									   around the role of the radiographers in theatre and CT environment, </td>
								  <td>and to arouse their interest in getting involved with advanced modalities. Regarding my research project, I
									 anticipate that my publication can influence other medical radiation practitioners positively by providing 
									 evidence-based advice focusing on the IPC in contrast delivery system. </td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Additionally, it can raise IPC awareness among other healthcare workers and specifically the staff in 
										the radiology department. The application of the IPC knowledge in my future placement sites and workplaces 
										will influence the other student radiographers and colleagues</td>
									<td>As a student radiographer, I have to obtain more clinical experience to further advance my inventiveness in 
										other modalities. I also need more participation in the university mentorship of junior student practitioners 
										and create a stronger positive impact on the medical radiation society and the medical field.
